   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to mpl-playback's documentation!
========================================

A library to record and then playback user interactions with a Matplotlib
figure. Also integrates with `sphinx-gallery <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html>`_
by providing a custom scraper so docs using widgets will render showing the interactions.
See this in action in the :doc:`Gallery <gallery/index>`.

Inspired by discussions here: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/19222


Developed on https://github.com/ianhi/mpl-playback PRs or comments welcome :)
